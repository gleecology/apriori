vanilla install
.apriori/do.install should take care of things.

NB
* must install perl before apache/mod_perl
* must run do.cpan_install.pl <module_list_file> after the apache install

It seems like apache+mod_perl+perl all need to be the same instal together. 
Some testing w/ swapping out perl installs (via opt_depot)  shows some wonkiness
