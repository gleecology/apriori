build some staticperl!

e-z intro: 

* use cpan to add App::Staticperl  to existing perl lib ( if you control that installation) 

* -OR- use .apriori/do.install to create a localized version ( creates link to staticperl in the $DEPOT/$PKG dir) 

* you can kill the install if it starts long running test; it basically is starting a build of perl in ~/.staticperl by default

* after, staticperl is another script just like perl, prove, or cpan.  

* export STATICPERLRC=/path/to/.apriori/staticperl.rc

* mkdir for what is $STATICPERL dest via the rc file. 

* run the build/install: 
    staticperl install 

* update the select modules we want present & available:
    bash .apriori/do.load_staticperl_cpan <file>    # defaults to our list at cpan_module_list.txt

* create the binary using a 'bundle' config (nb: uses cwd as working dir for some files and final output binary 'perl'):
    staticperl mkperl .aprirori/bundle.01
        # bundle.01:  select modules; NB: this is NOT the same as cpan_module_list.txt --need *ALL* the dependent modules too (rtfm)
        # bundle.02:   the kitchen sink!  everything loads in.  Bigger footprint but very usable throughout

* check out your binary:
    ldd ./perl
    ./perl -V
    ( cd .apriori && ../perl ./do.check_perl  )
    ( cd .apriori && ../perl ./do.static_check )

* can't really call it done until you have tested it in your env and know that it doesn't barf. 

  Obvious glitches: 
    * @INC is nulled out when it starts; but can be modified at runtime with 'use lib ...'
    

* putting the binary in GIT/SVN? consider using upx to compress/store this. 
    this should drop 12MB file down to 4MB (ymmv...)



----------development logging-----------------

perl-5.8.9 is the smallest distro to use. Saves 1-2MB overall in final binary image
