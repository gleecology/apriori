vanilla install
.apriori/do.install should take care of things.

NB
* must install perl before apache/mod_perl
* must run do.cpan_install.pl <module_list_file> after the apache install
* Cache::Memcached::Fast was manually forced install.  The errors did not grok; ignored!
* i installed this version after perl-5.8.9 which got mod_perl installed; so i did that one manually too.
